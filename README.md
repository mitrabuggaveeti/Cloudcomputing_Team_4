## Project Scope:

The specific problem that the machine learning component aims to address is the prediction of the probability of loanee/borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI (Equated Monthly Installments) on the due date. The financial institution is facing significant losses due to loan defaults, leading to tightened vehicle loan underwriting and increased rejection rates. In order to proactively address this issue and optimize the loan approval process, the organization aims to leverage machine learning to develop a sophisticated credit risk scoring model. This model's primary objective is to accurately predict the probability of a loanee or borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan, specifically within the initial EMI on the due date.

The machine learning model will utilize information from various datasets, including loanee information (demographic data), loan information (disbursed amount, asset cost, employment type), and bureau data & history (bureau score, number of active accounts, status of other loans, credit history, etc.). By analyzing these factors, the model will identify important determinants that contribute to the likelihood of loan default.

The project aligns with the educational program goals of AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering by incorporating key elements of data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing. Specifically, it involves:

* Data Engineering: The project requires handling and processing large datasets containing diverse information about loan applicants. This involves data cleaning, transformation, and integration to create a cohesive dataset for model training.

* Machine Learning: The core of the project involves developing a predictive model using machine learning algorithms. This includes selecting appropriate algorithms, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

* Cloud Computing: The use of AWS services can enhance the scalability, flexibility, and efficiency of the project. Cloud services like Amazon S3 for storage, AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), and SageMaker for machine learning model deployment can be incorporated.

* Analytics and Insights: The project aims to provide valuable insights into the determinants of vehicle loan default. This aligns with the goal of deriving actionable intelligence from data, a key aspect of data analytics.

* Risk Management: The project directly addresses the financial institution's need for better credit risk assessment. This aligns with the broader theme of risk management in data-driven decision-making, a crucial aspect covered in the educational program.

By successfully completing this project, the financial institution can optimize its loan approval process, reduce default rates, and make informed decisions based on predictive analytics. Notably, the anticipated outcome includes a substantial reduction in default rates, an important metric that directly impacts the institution's financial health. By accurately identifying the key determinants of default within the critical period of the first EMI on the due date, the model empowers the institution to proactively address risk factors and refine its underwriting criteria. This, in turn, contributes to a more robust lending portfolio, fostering sustainable growth and minimizing the financial challenges associated with loan defaults. Additionally, identifying key determinants of default can contribute to ongoing efforts to minimize risks associated with vehicle loans.
